The solution is often iterative and involves troubleshooting the underlying Gradle or Android SDK issues.  A systematic approach is essential:

1. **Clean the build:** Use `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the build cache. This can resolve transient issues.

2. **Update dependencies:** Run `expo upgrade` to update your project's dependencies to their latest versions.  Outdated dependencies can cause compatibility problems.

3. **Inspect Gradle logs:** The full Gradle output will provide more details on the error.  Carefully examine the log messages for clues about the root cause.

4. **Check Android/build.gradle:**  Review the `android/build.gradle` file carefully for any misconfigurations or typos.  Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and that the plugin versions are compatible.

5. **Verify native module configurations:**  If you are using native modules, ensure that they are properly configured and linked. Check their documentation for specific instructions.

6. **Invalidate caches/restart:** Invalidate caches and restart your IDE or terminal.  Sometimes, a fresh start resolves seemingly intractable issues.

7. **Search for similar issues:** Search online (e.g., Stack Overflow, Expo forums) for similar error messages.  Someone might have already encountered and resolved the same problem.

Example of examining Gradle logs:

```bash
# Look for specific error messages within the full Gradle build output
cat android/app/build/outputs/logs/install.log
```

By combining careful observation, systematic troubleshooting, and online resources, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the cryptic build error.
