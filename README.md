# Cryptic Expo CLI Android Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug error encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The issue manifests as a cryptic error message during the build process, usually related to Gradle, Android SDK, or native module issues.

The primary challenge lies in the vague and often unhelpful error messages. This makes identifying the root cause challenging. This repo aims to illustrate a possible scenario and offer a solution.

## How to Reproduce

The specific steps to reproduce this error can vary depending on your project's configuration and dependencies.  However, you may encounter this problem if:

* Dependencies are outdated or incorrectly configured.
* There are conflicts between native modules.
* `android/build.gradle` has incorrect settings.

## Solution

The solution may involve a combination of the following:

* Updating dependencies using `expo upgrade`.
* Carefully reviewing and correcting the configurations in `android/build.gradle` and related files.
* Resolving conflicts between native modules, possibly by adjusting versions or removing unused ones.
* Cleaning the build cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and retrying the build.
